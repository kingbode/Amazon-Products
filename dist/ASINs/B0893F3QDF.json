(Even the packaging was really good!)2) the price is something that is very reasonable if you consider the competition out there offering same specs.I’ve charged and tested with my iPhone 11 and my wife’s Samsung galaxy S8 and works great on both! I’ve also tried it with wireless headphones I have from Letscom and that works great too!Highly recommend this product if you’re looking for a fair priced, superior quality and robust & long lasting wireless charger!",

I used 3 Amp USB power adapter with voltmeter and amp meter.  If the phone was really low on charge this charter would shift to 9V 10 Watt charging mode.  The wireless charger ran hot which also caused the phone to get hot.  When I plug the power adapter  directly into the phone the phone charged at the 15W level and only became slightly warm.

I wish the price was still at $5.06, but even at $8.00, it's still a great deal. Note, you'll need to have an adapter (what gets plugged into the wall) to use this charger. And understand it will only charge at the speed of your adapter since the wireless charger is only the transferring conduit—the faster your adapter, e.g., amperage, the quicker the charge of your device.",

                    "Review_Text": "Initial impression:The packaging is exactly what you'd expect, nothing too ridiculous or too cheap. The silicone feet that keep it from sliding on a desk are GREAT, and don't slip at all like some matte finish silicone can. Construction quality is obviously cheap in terms of materials but high quality in terms of tooling and assembly.Charging Performance:On 5V: Charges fine, but only draws 1.1A from a 2.4A port, so the phone will be charging VERY slowly. Makes a barely audible chirping sort of squeal if you listen right up close. My go-to Qi pad is identical in both ways, and I'd never noticed before, so not an issue. There's a reason they say to use a QuickCharge charger to power these - you should.On QC3.0: Using my go-to, the charger switches to 9V supply, the phone waffles around a bit at first, then supply current slowly ramps up to wherever it will stay. For my iPhone, this was drawing about 7.5 to 8 watts. For this LETSCOM unit, input power pretty quickly ramped up to just over 9W. That difference probably has nothing to do with with the devices and everything to do with the charging state of the phone, and the specific positioning when I put the phone down.Good points:Performance is exactly what you'd expect for a Qi pad.The different LED colors to tell you what's going on is SUPER useful for diagnosing performance. I can imagine a lot of people figuring out that their magnetic case is why their phone never charges on a pad but heats up a lot.The non-slip material on both sides is perfectly designed.I appreciate the switch to USB-CBuild quality is great without being extravagant (mostly).Bad points:The USB-C socket on the pad itself is a little loose, which doesn't inspire confidence.Helpful as the LED is, it turns off to indicate a full battery. My phone already does that. I wish it turned off shortly after it indicated proper charging, to really eliminate extra light in, say, a bedroom. My other pad doesn't have helpful color indication, but it turns on green to say \"this is working,\" then turns off a few moments later to let you sleep. The LED isn't super bright, but it's still bright enough to be annoying trying to sleep at night.Overall:The performance of this pad is perfectly up to snuff, the price is great, and USB-C instead of Micro-B is convenient in my eyes. Usability is good in terms of slip, size, weight, etc. The biggest issue I have that keeps this from getting 5 stars is that light-sensitive sleepers will be annoyed by the constant blue LED, which is a problem other pads have already designed around.",

I love that I can just plop my phone on it and away it charges. The iPhone 11 Pro shows no signs of heating up while charging. Charges at the same speed that my extra long generic cable does.If only there was a way to charge via blue tooth, so I’d never have to set it down. 🤔 My husband got jealous and ordered one for his home office.The charging pad is super slender, which would make it easy to tuck in a pocket for travel, but the round disk doesn’t always fit in work bag accessory pockets.",

I wish the price was still at $5.06, but even at $8.00, it's still a great deal. Note, you'll need to have an adapter (what gets plugged into the wall) to use this charger. And understand it will only charge at the speed of your adapter since the wireless charger is only the transferring conduit—the faster your adapter, e.g., amperage, the quicker the charge of your device.",

                    "Review_Text": "Initial impression:The packaging is exactly what you'd expect, nothing too ridiculous or too cheap. The silicone feet that keep it from sliding on a desk are GREAT, and don't slip at all like some matte finish silicone can. Construction quality is obviously cheap in terms of materials but high quality in terms of tooling and assembly.Charging Performance:On 5V: Charges fine, but only draws 1.1A from a 2.4A port, so the phone will be charging VERY slowly. Makes a barely audible chirping sort of squeal if you listen right up close. My go-to Qi pad is identical in both ways, and I'd never noticed before, so not an issue. There's a reason they say to use a QuickCharge charger to power these - you should.On QC3.0: Using my go-to, the charger switches to 9V supply, the phone waffles around a bit at first, then supply current slowly ramps up to wherever it will stay. For my iPhone, this was drawing about 7.5 to 8 watts. For this LETSCOM unit, input power pretty quickly ramped up to just over 9W. That difference probably has nothing to do with with the devices and everything to do with the charging state of the phone, and the specific positioning when I put the phone down.Good points:Performance is exactly what you'd expect for a Qi pad.The different LED colors to tell you what's going on is SUPER useful for diagnosing performance. I can imagine a lot of people figuring out that their magnetic case is why their phone never charges on a pad but heats up a lot.The non-slip material on both sides is perfectly designed.I appreciate the switch to USB-CBuild quality is great without being extravagant (mostly).Bad points:The USB-C socket on the pad itself is a little loose, which doesn't inspire confidence.Helpful as the LED is, it turns off to indicate a full battery. My phone already does that. I wish it turned off shortly after it indicated proper charging, to really eliminate extra light in, say, a bedroom. My other pad doesn't have helpful color indication, but it turns on green to say \"this is working,\" then turns off a few moments later to let you sleep. The LED isn't super bright, but it's still bright enough to be annoying trying to sleep at night.Overall:The performance of this pad is perfectly up to snuff, the price is great, and USB-C instead of Micro-B is convenient in my eyes. Usability is good in terms of slip, size, weight, etc. The biggest issue I have that keeps this from getting 5 stars is that light-sensitive sleepers will be annoyed by the constant blue LED, which is a problem other pads have already designed around.",

Charges at the same speed that my extra long generic cable does.If only there was a way to charge via blue tooth, so I’d never have to set it down. 🤔 My husband got jealous and ordered one for his home office.The charging pad is super slender, which would make it easy to tuck in a pocket for travel, but the round disk doesn’t always fit in work bag accessory pockets.",

A tiny red LED comes on when power is applied, which turns blue when a device is placed on the pad correctly, and charging has begun. It is a little bright, but not bad if it is turned away from you.  The LED flashes red & blue of something is wrong, like a phone case with metal in or on it is placed on the pad, or some other reason the charge isn’t taking place. The metal will also get very hot. But a nonmetallic case works just fine, as long as it’s not too thick. Then the LED will go out when charging is complete, and the charger will turn off. I liked it so much, I ordered a second one for my wife on Prime Day at a considerable discount.",

This is my first wireless phone & charger so I have nothing to compare it with but for under $10 it seems like a good buy to me. If I had to call out one thing it would be the blue/red LED which is pretty bright at night and the way the charger normally orients in relation to the power cord it seems to be facing right at me at night, I just put my earbud case in front of it to block the light... the one I use on my desk, no big deal.

It was compatible with my old Galaxy s9 and also works for my Iphone XR. I will say that it doesn't charge my phone as quickly as the normal charger does, which I tested out by setting the phone on the charging pad which said it would take an hour to charge fully, and then plugged it into the original charger, which said it would take 40 minutes a charge fully. Not a huge difference honestly and I mostly use the charging pad for overnight charging, which I have had no issues with.All in all, great value for the price!

I honestly do not know if the package that includes the AC supply supports 12v or not. Higher voltage is ideal because you can push current more effectively through lesser cables (where I'd need 3A at 5V, I would only need 1.25A and 12V for the same total power). The way that's translated to the device itself on wireless power coils,that's a different conversation to have (versus directly plugging in a device that calls 7/9/12/15/20v power, the wireless charger itself is making that call, and will probably do so regardless of the target device, this is fine, circumstantially).Recommend, great price too.",

I've used it a couple nights in a row and a bit during the day and it seems to charge my Pixel 3 well. The phone never feels hot, neither does the pad. It seems to charge a bit faster compared to the Anker stand design charger I also tried out.My chief complaint is that the LED indicator light is way to freaking bright. If you're using it next to your bed at night, I recommend you be prepared to put some black tape over it. I started with some white electrical tape, but the light was still shining through way too brightly. I added a small piece of black duct tape over the electrical tape and most of the light is gone. There is enough seeping between the crack where the top and bottom pieces of the pad join that you can tell it's blue and charging in the dark, but faint enough you don't see it unless you're looking.",

Hopefully, the manufacturer is using a part that was designed to hold up for the expected life of the device.

It is VERY lightweight, thin (5/16\"), 3-7/8\" diameter, and has a charging indicator light on the side (red=not charging/blue=charging). I plugged it into a 3.0 quick charging wall charger (not included) and used their type C cable (included). My phone was at 49% charge when I tested the setup. Wireless charging timed at 1h 22m to full charge while wired charging time clocked at 50m. The 30m difference is likely due to the AC supporting 18W while this wireless pad supports up to 15W. So the wireless transfer of power is reduced. Using a non-quick setup (standard plug+cable) the charge time was 2h 47m. However, when I added the wireless pad to the non-quick setup the charge time improved to 1h 26m. So the pad was able to up the power transferred. If you register your product online, you can receive a 1 year warranty.Why not 5 stars? I would have liked the indicator light to be on the front of the unit (directly opposite the USB cable input. Since it is on the side it is difficult to see in daylight.",

I did try to use it to charge my fire tablet as other people said they used it for but it didn't work for me. Since I purchased it for my iPhone 11 not my fire 10, it didn't matter to me but I figured it was worth mentioning.Great value for the price, even if it only lasts 6 months (though hopefully it'll last longer).

It is sort of hard to position perfectly because it won’t charge if the phone is not in the perfect spot on the pad. It doesn’t come unplugged easy, and it stays in place well enough, it does have 3 little rubber pads on the bottom for traction. It takes a while to charge to 100% from dead.

Needless to say I am very disappointed in that. But it does charge and that’s what I need a charger so that’s why I give it 4 stars. It does the job plus it’s cute! Enjoy. I do recommend.

As I noted in some of the reviews prior to my purchase, the product does not come with the actual power adapter.  Not a huge deal (especially since I was expecting this).  Registering the warranty for the product was very easy.  The product does seem to work as described most of the time.  I have noticed that occasionally the product seems to lose power with no LED light showing even while the product was plugged in.  This is my first wireless charger and I will be reaching out to the company to discuss.  Could be something that I am doing wrong.",

It's nice to be able to just set your phone down on the charger instead of fiddling with a connector. I also enjoy the charging indicator. It turns blue when it's charging your device. This is useful because, with other chargers, you have to turn your phone screen on to see if the phone is charging. The indicator light makes it quick and easy to tell if the phone is placed correctly on the chargers. I would definitely recommend this product!!",

I have an iPhone, so it allows my port to be used for headphones for travel and I love that I don’t have to plug it into a wall to work like my other wireless charger, but I could if I wanted to. I will probably buy more. Great value for the money and a great product.",

I disconnected and let it rest a little and continue charging. But through a period of about 5 hrs, it did not reach 100% (i was lifting it once in a while but nothing more than 1 minute).

Just placing the phone on this little charger next to my bed is so convenient I won't even bother to have the phone fixed. I would never have thought that something as simple as charging an iPhone could be made even easier than it already is! I actually love this little device, which doesn't look bad either. It has a little red indicator for power, which turns blue when the phone is in place and charging. Next to the bed, at night the tiny blue light is no problem for sleeping either. Love it!",

Relatively speaking, the appearance adopts a more popular circular design, and the surface is made with anti-skid design, which can prevent the mobile phone from falling. What's more striking is that the charging is really much faster than the general wireless charging. Put it on the desk of the office, when not in use, put it on it for charging, and the battery is very strong every day. However, it should be noted that the charging speed of wireless charger connected with USB is relatively slow. It is better to equip with fast charging plug to experience the fast charging speed",

It's easy to verify when it is centered and charging because the red light turns blue while changing.  The charge rate seems fine and so much more convenient than plugging in the adapter.

The charger itself is so slim and elegant, and very easy to use. Just place the phone on the top to start charging. Now we don't need multiple chargers. No need to worry about the ports supported by your mobile device. It doesn't take up much space and has a stylish appearance. Very suitable as a bedside table or desk, and put down the phone before going to bed. The setup is very simple and easy to carry. I strongly recommend that you use a mobile phone that supports fast wireless charging.",

Charges my phone the same time as if I plugged in with the cable. So far I recommend it but if something changes I will update my review. This wireless charger is cheap enough so if last less than a year I will just buy another one. I usually buy 1 or 2 cables a year anyway cause I lose them.",

So when I ordered the LETSCOM Ultra Slim wireless charger,  I wasn't expecting much. Boy I was wrong. This is a fantastic charger.  There is a nice rubber pad on top, and rubber feet on the bottom, plus a LED charge indicator on the side.  The one thing that sold me on this unit, is the USB-C port on the side. I'm trying to use nothing but USB-C cables now.  Small and light weight, with a very slimline design, this charger really does an amazing job! I now can fast charge my Android phone, without using the now aging wired charging port on my phone!  I wished it came in blue, to match my desk!",

One of the main reasons why I bought this particular charger is because the previous one I bought (and returned the following day) wouldnt charge my phone through its case. I was nervous but per the description, this charger did charge through one extra mm of case then the other so I took a chance. The packaging was simple, the device is flat and very easily stored and all it took was plugging in my spare adapter and playing my phone in its case on top. Viola, it immediately began charging. Very satisfied with this product.",

I did attempt to charge older devices, that were not listed as compatible and they did not work, but I wasn't expecting them to work.

As a firefighter I have to get up and out the door quickly so I thought this would save on charging port wear.It only is more convenient in that it doesn’t have to be plugged in to the phone. It prevents me from playing on my phone when I should be asleep as you can’t use the phone and the charger at the same time.Dislikes- the LED is extremely bright blue and rarely turns off when phone is charged (this may be an apple functionality) blue light makes it hard to sleep.It takes a rather large power supply to power this (2amps) so the one that came with your phone won’t work and one isn’t included.",

My phone does not overheat when I charge it using this wireless charger. This is an issue I’ve had with other chargers, including my regular iPhone charger. This is a great wireless charger - highly recommend!!",

I use this with my pixel 3 and unlike other pads I've had it isn't super finicky about phone orientation or placement, it pretty much charges any way I the phone down on it. Size wise it's about 5\" in diameter but very thin so it would easily slip in to a travel bag. The only complaint I would have is the LED light is extremely bright so it lights up the entire side of my room, red when it's not being used and blue when the phone is on it. I personally have just covered the light with some black electrical tape. For future versions it might be nice to be able to turn off the light or have a dimmer light all together. As far as charging speeds go it's definitely significantly slower than plugging in directly to usb-c but I use it as an overnight charger and I've always woken up to a fully charged phone.",

It is essential to buy one with a high voltage and buy a charging plug that matches or excedes the capacity of the Qi charger in order to get the best results. This value charger strikes the perfect balance especially if you have a lot of extra plugs to use. The product comes with the charger and charging cable (usbc c to usb 3). It has a link to show you the charging status. The cable is of surprisingly good quality and when you place the phone on the charger it has a great grip/hold. After a little research it is marketed as \"Anti-slip\" protection. If you have another usbc-usbc cable of course take advantage of that and use it, but the most important thing is to make sure the charging plug is of sufficient wattage for the device (equal, but too much over would be a waste). I'm not sure I would recommend this for traveling use.  I wish Apple would simply move from lightening to 1 charging method for watch, air pods/beats,phone, and iPad. I know they want to bring back \"magsafe\" (i.e. magnetic qi charging basically with some AI software). but it won't be practically useful for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro on the intel line up. I digress... This is a great device to just keep in the living room during small groups/social gatherings (covid appropriate of course) where people can just drop it off and leave it to charge. Yes you can spend another 20 bucks to get something that will work a little faster. This is a great alternative especially if you already have 1 and you want a backup or an extra to use with others.",

But so far - it is charging very fast compared to other Qi chargers I had lying around the house that didn't charge my LG G8 Phone very fast at all and some were negatively charging... if that seems possible... But this one the  Letscom is connected with the USB-C cable they provide and I have it hooked up to a RavPower 2.4amp max output charging brick... I can't give the rates but will say that I had the phone hooked up to the Google Pixel charger that is I think 15watts, and the new Apple Qi charger that I think is also 15watts output - so they should have been faster but they weren't.This thing is thin and light. and powers quickly and my phone did not even get hot at all.I have been charging phones for years and used many different brands, so this isn't my first Rodeo.VERY GOOD CHARGER YOU WILL LIKE IT",

For years I have had cellphones that had charging pad capabilities but never though much about it...I was satisfied with using the standard charging cables.  A month ago I purchased a new car that came with a charging pad built into the console, so I tried it on the way home from the dealer...WOW I was amazed at how fast it charged and immediately began looking for a charging pad I could use at home.This charging pad did not disappoint.  I have one next to my chair in the living room and one in the bedroom.  I usually used the one in the bedroom to charge my phone overnight.  It charges my phone even through the double layered protective case and shuts off when the phone is completely charge.  I just place my phone on the charging pad and it is fully charged in the morning.For traveling I will probably still use the charging cable since I will need to bring a cable anyway and I prefer to travel light....with minimal luggage, minimum weight",

I love how the price of wireless chargers have gone down in recent years.This charger is very low profile and makes my desk look so much cleaner. I have no way to test if it actually outputs 15W like advertised, but my phone only accepts up to 10W.The light indicator is very obnoxious in the dark, so I just put a tiny bit of electrical tape over the light and I like it much better now. It also stays very cool during chargingIt's not great for traveling because wireless charging is inherently slower than wired charging, but it's great for just dropping on your desk while you work for a few hours. The great thing about wireless charging is not the speeds but the convenience. For the price, this is amazing. It's exactly what I need. I don't want a stand that makes my phone vertical. I also love that it's USB C (the same as my phone)",

When the blue light is on, it's charging. When the red light is on, it's on. You have to be very specific with the way you place your phone and make sure you don't accidentally knock it on your desk. Otherwise, that light might turn red and your phone won't be charging.I think this is a great mid-day product when you're doing work at your desk and you want to prevent your phone from draining. If you're looking for that no-rush, casual charge, this product is great. I've also used it a couple times for over night charging, but am not sure if there is an automatic stop when it meets 100%.Overall 4/5 bc its affordable and still works several weeks in.",

I loved the sleek design and the fact it was black. While using this charger the led light which indicated if my phone was charging, ensured I was doing so (which my other wireless chargers don’t do). It seems to be on par with my Samsung qi charger, I can tell no difference in charging rate. At this price point I got greater quality than I was expecting and is much better than my other wireless chargers! On the bottom were grips which made my charger stay in one place.I absolutely love this product!",

My other wireless charger had a ring of light that either flashed or stayed blue & I had to cover those lights up as well.

And, if you need more than 40\" to reach the nearest adapter or port, it works perfectly with any longer cord with a USB-C connector (as demonstrated in the attached review photo).My only complaint -- costing 1 star on travel -- is the 4\" diameter.  While probably already the smallest and thinnest 15W QI charger on the market, it doesn't quite fit the center console for use in either of our two cars.Otherwise, bottom line, these are the best I can find, come at a great price, and I am buying another one for the living room and might get a third one as a guest bedroom spare.",

Both cables (from different manufacturers) are incompatible with this charger when the other end is connected to my Lenovo Yoga and ThinkPad notebooks, or to my LG 4K display's USB-C port.The charger works great with the recommended USB Type-A AC adapter that is recommended by LETSCOM and sold separately. It also works with the Type-A USB 3.0/3.1 ports on my PCs (just not with the Type-C ports).",

At night, it can reflect off the wall and create a glow in the room. I just put a book or something next to the charger to block it. You could also just sharpie it or tape over it I suppose.",

With this one, I don't need to worry about that anymore.  I also recommend it for seniors who have trouble connecting cable head to devices.

This one works great right through both my wife's, and my phone case. It didn't work through my Scooch \"Wingman\" case but that case has a really thick hunk of plastic on the back that holds the bendy kickstand on. I switched over to another case I bought a while back and it works great. I ordered three more to place around the house.",

The black matte further makes it almost inconspicuous. I like the soft green indicator light, which indicates that the phone is properly set up on the charger and the connection is established.

I connected to a fast-charging adaptor, Charging time is pretty decent. It has rubber foot in the bottom to hold the wireless charger in one place. They have led light to show you if it is charging or not charging. The box contains the wireless charger base and USB C wire. No Adaptor. But for this price it is ok. Let's see how it holds in the coming months. Overall I like this product and it costs less than $10.The shipping was fast and the packing was good.",

I keep it on my bedside table and just lay my phone on it every night before bed and like magic it’s fully charged when I wake. The small issue is the LED that stays on while it’s on the charger. If you like a dark bedroom like me, you will be disappointed. It is way to bright. I wish it came on momentarily to show that your phone is changing, then went out, that would be ideal. I put a piece of black electrical tape over it to cover it up. For the price, great charger",

The lights will flicker just after recognition, which is very cool, and it will not flash after a few flashes. Moreover, the body is small and can be placed anywhere. I use it in the office. It looks very high-tech, and it is really convenient. Just put the phone on it.",

Best of all it comes complete. Most charging pads do not include the adaptor. This one does. This is a super buy for a quality product. I really like mine.

But if I charge my phone at a slower speed, it lasts way longer. So I like to attach wireless chargers like these to 1amp plugs to charge slowly, and leave my phone on it over night, or sitting at my desk. And my battery life is way faster. Highly recommend people try using these to slowly charge your phone instead.",

My only two complaints are 1- you need to take the case off in order to charge. They aren't case friendly.2- they are slow charging. I mean SLOW. If you charge and use at the same time your battery continues to drain so you can't multitask at all.I'd still recommend these for the excellent value and ease of function, especially when traveling.",

This wireless charger was easy the setup and charged my phone very fast. I have a case on my phone and it didn't even matter. It charged it regardless and when it was done it did turn off. I highly recommend this product!",

The only down side I have seen is that the quality it not as great as I would like, so I ding it on the travel rating, as I feel over time it will break easily!!!",

But the light does change from red to blue to show contact with the base and indicate charging has started. It seemed to fast charge but not quite as fast as my actual fast charging usb cable does. I had to buy a qi wireless receiver to give my battery a wireless charging ability. The receiver may be to blame for the slower fast charge. Also, it doesn't show the icon for fast charging when I use this receiver charger combo. Again, it could be the receiver. Bought for LG Stylo 5",

Tried it on my mom's phone....same thing happened. Then I moved the charger to different locations to see if it was the outlet. Nope. Finally I tried to look at the user manual and that didn't help either. I also tried calling the company but it kept going to voicemail. All in all, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

That hasnt happened yet. Sometimes when I get up it’s only at 60-65% so I still have to use my regular charger. I’ve experimented with different placements of the phone and still the same results. I have an Iphone 11 Pro Max and from less than 10% to 100% usually takes an hour to an hour and a half but, with this wireless pad, I’ve placed it on for over 4 hours and the most I have gotten is around 50% more battery life.

I tried different outlets, I swapped out different “cubes” (it is a bit annoying this product doesn’t come with its own) and I finally tested it against other chargers in the same conditions. I had to admit, this product just didn’t work. I started to notice that there were times the indicator light would not turn on, or that it would switch from its charging mode. Unfortunately, it seems I got the lemon. It’s too bad, because from other items, I thought I could trust Letscomm. Suffice to say, I won’t be purchasing this again.",

Also, it has issues maintaining a connection. I'm not sure what causes this, but it will connect and reconnect on its own several times without me moving or adjusting the phone on the pad. It is very unpredictable how long it will maintain a good connection. Also, sometimes it will remain disconnected and will not charge your device at all.The screenshots I attached show my phone (Galaxy Note 20 Ultra) charging on the LetsCom pad and plugged in to the Samsung charger my phone came with. At 35% battery, the LetsCom pad is projected to take 2 hours and 51 minutes until it fully charges the phone. Conversely, the wired charger that came with my phone projects a charge time of 53 minutes when the battery life is 35%.Long story short:I would NOT recommend this product at all for 3 reasons:1) NOT a fast charger as it is advertised2) Unpredictably loses charging connection3) Generates an incredible amount of heatI hope this helps any prospective buyers.

I tried 4 different phones, removed their cases, moved the phones different ways, and nothing worked. I called the LETSCOM customer service number, and was put on hold by an automated answering service, then after a few minutes on hold, I was told to leave a message. I have not received a call back from their customer service department yet. That was 7 days ago.",

I too initially offered a five-star review out of the box, as I plugged it in, it worked, and everything seemed great.  Six months later, not so much.  The pad is much slower to \"see\" and begin charging my phone than the three other pads in the house.  Also, it somehow loses it's connection to the phone - often overnight - so it's not unusual to get up in the morning and find the phone only partially charged.  Same phone, same cover on the phone, same everything else (as far as I can tell).  In the end, I got so fed up having to position and re-position the phone to get charging started, and with the overnight problem, I decided to throw the thing away and start again.",

It's not bad, and it functions, but it's not great and a lot slower than my charger which should be the same based on the listings from the page.It also causes my battery to get VERY hot, which slows down the charge, even more, I doubt this is even Qi-Certified as stated. After for only 20 mins of charging (no case) directly to phone the battery in my phone hit 105f, which is the very limit lithium batteries can reach without overheating. They are known to swell and catch fire at 113f that is a minimal difference even more so when you consider it was only on the charger for less than 20 mins. If I was to charge the device on it entirely, there is a good chance it could have gone passed the safety limit.I feel this device is lacking the safety features it claims, it does not charge at the speed listed and causes my phone to become very hot. For those reasons (a significantly slower charge, the added heat far above charging by line, and the risk to the battery long term) I will not use this.",

If I remove it and replace it at that point the light will go off , however it still seems to be doing something as the pad and phone stay warm. Maybe this is a function of this type of charger but my wifes phone charger does not do this , it shuts off and cools down' I'm not sure what the implications for the phones battery life are if it stays warm. This happened with the first item and and gain with the replacement so it wasn't just a bad one. I will have to send it back . Also I didn't find it that easy to place the phone in the exact right spot to start charging , you have to rely on the light and phone feedback to make sure its placed correctly.

There's not much to think about when setting it up, basically plug and go.  When you are charging you get a notification light to let you know that it is charging.  Due to its size compared to my phone size, this comes in really handy if I'm not near it to make sure its still charging.The bad.  My two main concerns are size and charging speed .  I have a Galaxy S20+ and its always a minor task to get it on properly and begin charging.  It has a small base that shaped sort of if you flipped a small plate over. So its not completely flat making it a chore to charge. I could only imagine the fun if your device charging hardware wasn't centered.  The speed of charging is my main issue though. I'm not sure why \"FAST\" is in the description. The amount of power I get from charging say 1hr on this wireless charger, i can get with 10-15min on a plug.  I expected way more considering the description. Perhaps its the technology but nevertheless... Its definitely not to be used if you are usually in a rush. The actual charging area is also very small so you'll often have to play around to find the spot. If you bump it, or the desk, you're back to the drawing board.Overall, the device is okay. It does what it should with some work.  I find that its a decent device to say put next to your bed while you sleep.  Just make sure its on and stays on properly.  But for those on the go, I wouldn't recommend as you'll be disappointed when retrieving  your device to find you only gained 5-10% after an hour.Would i recommend it?  probably not.  If i can get 50% charge in around 30mins with a cable vs 50% charge is several hours with this thing...I'll take the cable.",

These power supplies are also often referred to as, \"wall warts\". While I'm sure this thing will charge a phone, I have some concerns about how it's marketed, as it's being sold without a power supply, yet it states that it's a 15 Watt charger. What they are really telling you, I believe, is that with the right size power supply, its max charge rate is 15 Watts. This thing has no wattage, of its own. The charging voltage comes from the power supply. This just processes and distributes it. This fact should be clearly started, and also clearly stated should be the current ratings for each voltage that it can charge at, in order to achieve 15 Watts of charge, as those will be the max ratings for the power supply & would serve as a buying guide for the power supply. I'm fairly certain that the 15 Watts is a ceiling, and that if you use too powerful of a power supply, you could damage the charger. For example, most folks will use it for their cell phones, and they charge at 5 Volts. So, I saw a statement by the seller, saying that if you were to use a 5 Volt power supply, rated at 2 Amps, you'd be charging at only 5 Watts. But, what if I use a 7 Amp power supply? Will that be too much for this unit. Who knows, as no body is bothering to tell you. I will say that finding power supplies rated higher than 2 to 3 Amps isn't quite so easy, and hopefully that fact will prevent most folks from exceeding the limits of this unit. It just needs a far better description of it's functions and how to use it. Plus, another reviewer, who seemed to be pretty experienced with this type of charger, rated this one as mediocre and lacking features. Unfortunately, I bought 2 of them. Not sure if I'll keep them. I'll use a formula to determine what the max current is from a power supply at 5 Volts, without exceeding 15 Watts, and buy accordingly. Then, I'll try one of them for 28 days, and if I don't like them, I'll be returning both under Amazon's 30 day return window. Also, for those who don't know the formula for converting Amps to Watts, do an internet search for, \"Watts from Volts and Amps\". Enter 5 Volts (or the voltage that you're using) and then enter the current rating of the transformer you're considering. It'll compute the wattage for you.",

I really don’t use usb type A anymore, so I don’t want to use the supplied usb A-to-C cable.It’s fairly slim and small but it’s surface is not flat but rather saucer-shaped, so although it’s stable on a flat surface, it wasn’t good for my purpose because I really wanted to super-glue it to a near-vertical surface and use it.It’s decent value for the price.",

I reapplied the phone to the charger and after about 1 minute, it again jumped to 100% charged. Again, restarting the phone brought the charge down to 97%. I had high hopes for the Letscom wireless charger due to its compatible specs for my phone, excellent reviews and probably the most affordable wireless charger on the market. It even looks fantastic and is super slim with proper ventilation, plus it has a USB C port so plugging in my Google Pixel 4 stock charging brick and the Google branded USB-C cable fit perfect.

Unfortunately, the fast charging mode doesn't work on mine even though my phone is a brand new S10+ and I've tried it with two Samsung fast charging adapters (the one that came with my phone and one I already had). If I unplug the pad and plug the cable directly into my phone using either adapter, my phone fast charges, so it's not the adapters, the cable, or my phone. The difference at 30% battery to full charge is an hour of charging time (~1h45m on the cable vs ~2h45m on the pad). Since the pad is so cheap and it is convenient to have a few around the house/for traveling, I probably won't return the ones I've already ordered, but I'll be looking elsewhere for one that actually fast charges.",

It seems that when the phone is fully charged, it turns off and the charger doesn't know to turn back on.  This is nuts and makes the charger useless to me.

The phone charges fine when plugged directly into the charger or when I use a different wirless charger. This was very inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.",

However, this cheap peace of plastic takes forever to charge fully. It takes about 3-5 minutes to see the the phone booting after a full discharge. It also takes a few tries to position the phone correctly “. The worst part is that it takes about 8 hours for a full charge - assuming not using you phone at all.

It worked great while it worked, but this morning I realized that it was no longer charging my headphones. I switched to my phone—same issue. I replaced the cord and tried another outlet; nothing. I remember reading the comments about this charger suddenly failing to charge. I thought that my charger wouldsomehow be different. Well, it wasn’t. It just stopped working out of nowhere just like the rest of the comments said. I don’t recommend this device unless you’re planning on buying a replacement every 2-3 months.",

And the Samsung can max charging 10w speed for the wireless charger; it must be slower than you use the original fast charging block, because it is design for Samsung, but our wireless charger could be compatible with many cellphones.\nThe phone will automatically limit the charging current in a trickle state while the power is more than 80% because of the protection purpose; At this time, the charging current is relatively small, so charging is not so fast.",

                    "Answer_": "Sometimes, the phone is not CENTERED on the charger.  Sometimes, it is rotated and not straight.  Simply move the phone slowly up or down until the light is nearly in the middle of the left side of the phone.  Or rotate the phone very slightly until the wire seems to be coming straight out of the bottom of the phone.  Make sure the phone is not upside down.  Make sure the phone is not facing the bottom of the charger.  Make sure the CASE the phone is in is not so thick that the phone is now too far away from the charger.  \nThe sad bottom line is that the iPhone 12 was manufactured with internal magnetism designed to work with its own proprietary charger.  When I shopped for my iPhone 12 and the honest salesclerk revealed this to me, I bought an iPhone 11 instead, and it works perfectly with this charger.  \n(You may have to go back to the Apple store and buy an iPhone 12 wireless charger)",
