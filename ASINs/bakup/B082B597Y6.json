I am going to split this review into 3 sections: The Good, The Neutral, and The Bad. Keep in mind that as of the writing of this review, I have had the keyboard for only a few hours and will be updating this review in the future if something comes up.The Good-Pairing: The keyboard is easy to pair and connects pretty fast every time you turn it on.-USB C: Charges through USB C which means you don‚Äôt have to struggle when plugging it in.-Keyboard: The characters show up instantly when typing so there‚Äôs no need to worry about latency. There are also plenty of useful keys on the very top row which controls music, screen brightness, volume, etc.-Hinge: Being able to rotate the screen is super useful when you want to write/draw something with the Apple Pencil and also for watching videos.-Removable case: The ability to remove the rubber case which houses the iPad and Apple Pencil is really nice for those who don‚Äôt want to carry around the added weight of the keyboard.The Neutral-Round keys: If you are a decent typist and you are familiar with the regular QWERTY keyboard layout, you wont have a problem adjusting to the keyboard.-Trackpad: It has a clickable area on the bottom area which is split into a left click and a right click. The reason this is in the ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù section and not the ‚ÄúGood‚Äù section is because there seems to be an issue where the cursor moves all over the place when typing but I have found that disabling the trackpad (Top row key) and making sure your palms don‚Äôt touch the trackpad can help with this issue. Another thing that is annoying is that some of the gestures do not work. However, I‚Äôm hopeful that these issues are an IPadOS issues which can be resolved through software updates and not due to the design of the keyboard.-Weight Distribution: The case will tip over if you adjust it at anything more than About 100 degrees in the ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù position but I cant really knock any points off because the only solution to this would be to increase the weight of the keyboard which would probably make it a burden to carry.-Build Quality: It‚Äôs okay but we‚Äôll have to see how it holds up over time.The Bad-Pen Holder: Seriously? This would not be an issue if the holder was place on the side of the iPad where the volume rockers are! This alone is making me knock the overall rating down to 4 stars. When you place the Apple Pencil in the holder, it blocks the power button which isn‚Äôt a big deal when waking up the iPad but gets very annoying when trying to put it to sleep. This wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if the case had an automatic sleep/wake feature when closing it but it doesn‚Äôt so if you have an Apple Pencil, be prepared to struggle.I hope my Insights are helpful to those who are on the fence of buying this product.",

I like it is self supported and doesn‚Äôt  need a brace in the back to hold up the screen.  It‚Äôs heavy.  Bluetooth connectivity and key inputs are instant.  They are rounded keys which takes some getting used to, but good.  One note, if you open up the case too far for viewing, it gets top heavy and wants to tip over.  Not a big deal, but minor annoyance.  The touchpad works as it should.  It‚Äôs touchpad is convenient when using on the run, although a mouse would probably be easier to navigate and more precise.  The charging cord is way too short,  you basically need to charge within inches of a power outlet.  The backlit keys are a nice touch.  I like that the hinge is versatile enough to allow the iPad to sit flat on the keyboard  for those times you don‚Äôt need the keyboard yet don‚Äôt want to remove the iPad from the case. Overall it is a good value for all the features you get,  especially if you need a hard protective case with a touchpad.  I would buy again.",

This is the case for you!I normally don‚Äôt take the time to do reviews, but this keyboard case is so good, I just had to!Pros: backlit keyboard with several color choices; swivel hinge for multiple viewing angles (even tablet mode while still in the case)!Soft texture allows you to grip without it slipping easily; Detachable iPad cover (you can pull your iPad out and use it independently with a border case and stylus holder!)Did i mention the trackpad with control gestures! C‚Äômon, you have to ‚Äúgive it up‚Äù for that!This keyboard charges via USB C.Large size ‚Äúshift‚Äù key on right side (You may not realize how important that is until you start typing regularly on the keyboard)Cons: round keys take a little while to get used to....but no problemYou have to be careful where you place your hands and thumbs while you type. Sometimes you could hit the trackpad by mistake while typing.(Note: I did not receive any compensation or discount for this review)",

Otherwise I have no idea where I‚Äôm typing as the touch pad will move the insert cursor all over the place merely by hovering over the pad. I don‚Äôt know of any way to really adjust that without affecting the overall usefulness of the touchpad. Just remember to turn it back on when you are through typing.

Keyboard and it lights up to which is really good for getting work done at night and the pencil holder is really comes in handy  and the 30hours of battery life is awesome i can charge less for like minutes minimum and work more and it still gets me through the day and I like how i can switch to a tablet by folding the keyboard and don‚Äôt get the keyboard in the back and if i wanted to playa touch based game i can take the tablet out the keyboard part and i have the whole iPad with the pencil holder still attached this the best keyboard in my opinion known to manAnd the trackpad feels really luxurious in my opinion",

The typewriter style circle keys are a bit funky but u get used to it after a few minutes. If u have a 9.7‚Äù and want those 3 features this is your only option. Plenty of other options with pencil holder but they all require a ‚Äòkickstand‚Äô back to keep the screen up so won‚Äôt really work on your lap.",

No puedo mas que decir que lo re recomiendo y me extra√±a que no tenga tantos revisados en youtube, tal vez me anime a realizar uno.",

I like that the hinge is versatile enough to allow the iPad to sit flat on the keyboard  for those times you don‚Äôt need the keyboard yet don‚Äôt want to remove the iPad from the case. Overall it is a good value for all the features you get,  especially if you need a hard protective case with a touchpad.  I would buy again.",

This is the case for you!I normally don‚Äôt take the time to do reviews, but this keyboard case is so good, I just had to!Pros: backlit keyboard with several color choices; swivel hinge for multiple viewing angles (even tablet mode while still in the case)!Soft texture allows you to grip without it slipping easily; Detachable iPad cover (you can pull your iPad out and use it independently with a border case and stylus holder!)Did i mention the trackpad with control gestures! C‚Äômon, you have to ‚Äúgive it up‚Äù for that!This keyboard charges via USB C.Large size ‚Äúshift‚Äù key on right side (You may not realize how important that is until you start typing regularly on the keyboard)Cons: round keys take a little while to get used to....but no problemYou have to be careful where you place your hands and thumbs while you type. Sometimes you could hit the trackpad by mistake while typing.(Note: I did not receive any compensation or discount for this review)",

No puedo mas que decir que lo re recomiendo y me extra√±a que no tenga tantos revisados en youtube, tal vez me anime a realizar uno.",

My brother has the 7th gen ipad and a case similar to this one and this one is by far better. The buttons I was unsure about but were better then my previous case and my brothers similar case from a different manufacturer. The rounded buttons I thought would be a detractor but are actually better then the squared off imo.Now on to the bad. While never having a crack or scratch on this ipad (Or any device I have ever owned) .While pressing in the ipad from the rubber casing( that comes with the case) to the actual case. The pressure this must have caused cracked my screen and made it spider all over the device. Fortunately the device is still usable but my plan was to use this device to show off projects to investors. Now with a broken screen I will be forced to go buy a new Ipad I can not afford due to the pandemic...... thanks guys.This was a 5th gen ipad.Also the pen holster should be detachable. My device can not use use the apple pen Which makes the feature pointless. Only 6th gen can use the Apple Pencil.",

My brother has the 7th gen ipad and a case similar to this one and this one is by far better. The buttons I was unsure about but were better then my previous case and my brothers similar case from a different manufacturer. The rounded buttons I thought would be a detractor but are actually better then the squared off imo.Now on to the bad. While never having a crack or scratch on this ipad (Or any device I have ever owned) .While pressing in the ipad from the rubber casing( that comes with the case) to the actual case. The pressure this must have caused cracked my screen and made it spider all over the device. Fortunately the device is still usable but my plan was to use this device to show off projects to investors. Now with a broken screen I will be forced to go buy a new Ipad I can not afford due to the pandemic...... thanks guys.This was a 5th gen ipad.Also the pen holster should be detachable. My device can not use use the apple pen Which makes the feature pointless. Only 6th gen can use the Apple Pencil.",

The screen will also swivel 360 degrees so I sometimes turn it around backwards from the keyboard and can go all the way out to 180 degrees...helpful if you are only reading or just using the touchscreen.",
