The molded plastic bottoms provides a much better standing surface, and these look amazing in person. Very good build quality for the price.

I‚Äôm very surprised with the quality of these shoes, considering where they are made (hint: definitely not in the States, as it says ‚ÄúJust So So‚Äù and other random sayings around the shoe). The insert is pretty cushioned, and they don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre too hard on the bottoms when walking. However, I would not recommend running or working out in these since they don‚Äôt offer the support for that - these are strictly for fashion and basic walking around.I got these men‚Äôs shoes because they don‚Äôt have my size in women‚Äôs, so if you‚Äôre a gal, just know they‚Äôre a little clunky! If that doesn‚Äôt bother you, then you‚Äôre golden. I wear these with ankle skinny jeans and a basic t-shirt or hoodie and I feel like I‚Äôm back in the L.A. homeland already.They also have this awesome neon color that can double as an aircraft marshalls‚Äô guide on flight lines ;) anyway, these are a great buy if you want street fashion, but don‚Äôt want to pay the Yeezy price tag to get it. I totally expect to get them in at least one or two more colors!",

However, I would not recommend running or working out in these since they don‚Äôt offer the support for that - these are strictly for fashion and basic walking around.I got these men‚Äôs shoes because they don‚Äôt have my size in women‚Äôs, so if you‚Äôre a gal, just know they‚Äôre a little clunky! If that doesn‚Äôt bother you, then you‚Äôre golden. I wear these with ankle skinny jeans and a basic t-shirt or hoodie and I feel like I‚Äôm back in the L.A. homeland already.They also have this awesome neon color that can double as an aircraft marshalls‚Äô guide on flight lines ;) anyway, these are a great buy if you want street fashion, but don‚Äôt want to pay the Yeezy price tag to get it. I totally expect to get them in at least one or two more colors!",

Overall these are worth the money, they don‚Äôt really have much of a break in like other shoes, it‚Äôs pretty nice. But like I said I‚Äôm adjusting from flat skate shoes so my opinion may differ from others. So short term ownership I‚Äôd overall say they are good. I have a little wider feet than average and they fit pretty well, they do have stretch and do the job of a walking shoe.

I really like the style and comfort, but ordered the same size as I was getting in shoes that were described as for men or women and these were about a half size larger than I expected.  These are truer to men's sizing than some other shoes marketed to women as well. Just keep that in mind when ordering.",

Well that accurately describes this purchase. Although modern looking, this shoe is incredibly cheap. First, the sole feels like you‚Äôre pushing down on concrete. There‚Äôs no comfort to the shoe whatsoever. Second, the heel support flexes down and back so it feels like you‚Äôre sinking into the back of the shoe. You can feel the base through the sole which lead to blisters on my feet. Also, after two days of wearing I noticed the Shoes started making farting sounds from the heel area. So over all I‚Äôd say this shoe is ‚Äúso-so‚Äù at best if best is described as an uncomfortable feeling and flatulent sounding shoe. It‚Äôs an excellent party favor though. When people see the ‚Äújust so-so‚Äù label on the side of the shoe laughter ensues. This causes me to think. What if every company started creating slogans that accurately depicted the quality of their products?",

The fabric is reasonably comfortable and I think it will wear well (durable).  On a different sole, I think the shoe would be comfortable.So, that‚Äôs it - I don‚Äôt like the soles.  They look ok, however, they feel like plastic.  I‚Äôm heavy and the shoes don‚Äôt offer much support (they don‚Äôt give at all, they feel like I‚Äôm wearing wooden clogs).For working out, I normally wear running shoes.  I used to wear five fingers - I haven‚Äôt found them where I live, so I‚Äôve had to look at other options.  If you‚Äôre not familiar with 5-fingers, they are essentially gloves for your feet and offer no support.  Even so, they are more comfortable than the ‚Äújust so so‚Äù brand (from my perspective)....  (I offer the 5-finger perspective to explain that I‚Äôve happily worn shoes with ‚Äúno support‚Äù and I‚Äôd rather work out barefooted than work out in these ‚Äújust so so‚Äù shoes.)To be clear, I am not endorsing the five finger brand, nor am I encouraging you to buy some other shoe - I‚Äôm just providing a reference.Anyway - I like the uniqueness of the shoe and would recommend them if they were more comfortable.  For me, the sole is too rigid so the support isn‚Äôt there for me.I gave 2-stars because my wife loves them (5-stars from her) and I‚Äôm not a fan....  even so, if you buy them, I hope you like them.",

                    "Review_Text": "I got caught up in the \"must try\" trend on these and tried them for the first time today.Let me just start by saying I'm athletic and over the years, (I won't say how many, but it is more than three decades), I have worn most of the brands of shoes by trial and error in training, races, and for every day gym use.  I go through a new pair of running shoes every two months or so because they get miled out.  I consistently use about three major brands and need stability due to overpronation.These on first try on were stiff in the soles but a little flexible in the lacings.  They stayed stiff in the soles through their first workout.  They give back ZERO when you're wearing them.  There is no foam or gel in there anywhere-just an insole to keep you from jarring on the crinkly hard plastic sole.  They have some flex in the midfoot but as soon as they flex, those hard plastic wings on the side that hold the last lace hole will jab you in the ankle.  The lace holding wings anchor the laces, which is good because the rest of the lacing is just through sewn to the top loops that aren't lined up very well to give you a custom fit when you try to cinch them or move them around.  The lacing also seems too high on the foot, it starts midfoot instead of lower above the toes.  Lastly, the shoes give a really hard ride and even walking will make you wonder if you have shin splints.  I also have the suspicion that for my pair at least, the left shoe is different in construction than the right...something feels off.  Production quality is definitely as lacking as the tech in these babies.All in all, I hate to be less than positive, but these shoes are really just for looks.  I love the colors and the SO SO tape on them, they're like if Ikea made running shoes, this would be them.  They look like a running shoe, cost a small penny, and ultimately  they do go on your feet.  I guess I'd keep them in the bugout bag just in case, but I sure wouldn't run or workout in them.  I gave them two stars for style & color.",

However the shoe strings are very basic and there was really no way to tighten and tie them due to how it's made. When I did the elastic part under the shoe string bunched up and made it super uncomfortable. Plus it was a wide show to me. I wear 13's but I had another pair of similar build shoes on, and there was no comparison on how they fit/looked. Realize these are at the bottom of the price spectrum but regardless I wasn't too pleased. Maybe smaller feet they fit better on but for me it just didn't work out I guess but give them a try if u like. They look good in pics and in person but just beware if you have a larger foot.",

I took them out the next day 3 miles and at first they were comfortable I was able to do my first mile in 19 mins (usually takes me 21 mins in my old shoes) thats when I noticed the burning in my backs of my heel(s), when I got home I took off my shoes and socks to examine my heels they were a little raw but no skin broken. I took them out today for my usual 5 miles and I couldn't get half way on my usual routine when I started noticing blood coming my sock. These shoes have something metal in the back of the shoes that pierce the heel, I can feel my heels rubbing up against it as I walk. I really had a lot of hope with these shoes but I am having to return them. I'll just upfront the money I was going to pay for a better pair.",

Well that accurately describes this purchase. Although modern looking, this shoe is incredibly cheap. First, the sole feels like you‚Äôre pushing down on concrete. There‚Äôs no comfort to the shoe whatsoever. Second, the heel support flexes down and back so it feels like you‚Äôre sinking into the back of the shoe. You can feel the base through the sole which lead to blisters on my feet. Also, after two days of wearing I noticed the Shoes started making farting sounds from the heel area. So over all I‚Äôd say this shoe is ‚Äúso-so‚Äù at best if best is described as an uncomfortable feeling and flatulent sounding shoe. It‚Äôs an excellent party favor though. When people see the ‚Äújust so-so‚Äù label on the side of the shoe laughter ensues. This causes me to think. What if every company started creating slogans that accurately depicted the quality of their products?",

The fabric is reasonably comfortable and I think it will wear well (durable).  On a different sole, I think the shoe would be comfortable.So, that‚Äôs it - I don‚Äôt like the soles.  They look ok, however, they feel like plastic.  I‚Äôm heavy and the shoes don‚Äôt offer much support (they don‚Äôt give at all, they feel like I‚Äôm wearing wooden clogs).For working out, I normally wear running shoes.  I used to wear five fingers - I haven‚Äôt found them where I live, so I‚Äôve had to look at other options.  If you‚Äôre not familiar with 5-fingers, they are essentially gloves for your feet and offer no support.  Even so, they are more comfortable than the ‚Äújust so so‚Äù brand (from my perspective)....  (I offer the 5-finger perspective to explain that I‚Äôve happily worn shoes with ‚Äúno support‚Äù and I‚Äôd rather work out barefooted than work out in these ‚Äújust so so‚Äù shoes.)To be clear, I am not endorsing the five finger brand, nor am I encouraging you to buy some other shoe - I‚Äôm just providing a reference.Anyway - I like the uniqueness of the shoe and would recommend them if they were more comfortable.  For me, the sole is too rigid so the support isn‚Äôt there for me.I gave 2-stars because my wife loves them (5-stars from her) and I‚Äôm not a fan....  even so, if you buy them, I hope you like them.",

                    "Review_Text": "I got caught up in the \"must try\" trend on these and tried them for the first time today.Let me just start by saying I'm athletic and over the years, (I won't say how many, but it is more than three decades), I have worn most of the brands of shoes by trial and error in training, races, and for every day gym use.  I go through a new pair of running shoes every two months or so because they get miled out.  I consistently use about three major brands and need stability due to overpronation.These on first try on were stiff in the soles but a little flexible in the lacings.  They stayed stiff in the soles through their first workout.  They give back ZERO when you're wearing them.  There is no foam or gel in there anywhere-just an insole to keep you from jarring on the crinkly hard plastic sole.  They have some flex in the midfoot but as soon as they flex, those hard plastic wings on the side that hold the last lace hole will jab you in the ankle.  The lace holding wings anchor the laces, which is good because the rest of the lacing is just through sewn to the top loops that aren't lined up very well to give you a custom fit when you try to cinch them or move them around.  The lacing also seems too high on the foot, it starts midfoot instead of lower above the toes.  Lastly, the shoes give a really hard ride and even walking will make you wonder if you have shin splints.  I also have the suspicion that for my pair at least, the left shoe is different in construction than the right...something feels off.  Production quality is definitely as lacking as the tech in these babies.All in all, I hate to be less than positive, but these shoes are really just for looks.  I love the colors and the SO SO tape on them, they're like if Ikea made running shoes, this would be them.  They look like a running shoe, cost a small penny, and ultimately  they do go on your feet.  I guess I'd keep them in the bugout bag just in case, but I sure wouldn't run or workout in them.  I gave them two stars for style & color.",

However the shoe strings are very basic and there was really no way to tighten and tie them due to how it's made. When I did the elastic part under the shoe string bunched up and made it super uncomfortable. Plus it was a wide show to me. I wear 13's but I had another pair of similar build shoes on, and there was no comparison on how they fit/looked. Realize these are at the bottom of the price spectrum but regardless I wasn't too pleased. Maybe smaller feet they fit better on but for me it just didn't work out I guess but give them a try if u like. They look good in pics and in person but just beware if you have a larger foot.",

Unfortunately, the only label inside these shoes list these two numbers (265 and 43) without any reference as to what these numbers represent.  Typically, shoes list the width using letters with the average width being \"D\".  These shoes are for my son and I just had him try them on.  He said the width feels normal, so \"D\" width is the best guess I can give you.  Hope this helps.  DMD",
