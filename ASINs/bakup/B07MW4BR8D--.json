I am praying it holds up better than the soft nib or the plastic hard nibs.-Magnetic charging and doesnt need batteries-looks good with LED-easy on/off buttonCons:- not magnetic on the sides therefore wont stick to the side of my surface. The only magnetic part is the clip and the top but the clip isnt strongly magnetized enough.- the USB wire it came with doesnt work- no eraser or right click button- sometimes lags when I'm trying to select stuff- there were some scratches on it when I got it",

Very misleading, it's a bait and switch HP in the title in THIS listing, then I found this same pen same listing, without HP mentioned... Even Amazon is turning into a bunch of BS stores built with all this content to mislead for the bait and switch.

This pen also simply acts like a very pointy finger so if your device supports multiple touch points (e.g. 4 finger gestures) then it will work but your other fingers will also work. The good thing about this is that it works like a finger so you don't need to pair said finger to your devices. Note however that just like a finger it will not be the best stylus for tablets and phones as compared to the dedicated stylus for said devices. Tried it on my Note 8 and Acer Alpha Switch 12  (was hoping to find 1 stylus to write notes on both seamlessly) but the latency cannot be compared to the original styli. In short, I am cannot use it for note taking.",
