<+># Amazon-Products\r\ntake Amazon Product ASIN and retrieve , Product Profile , Reviews and Questions\r\n==============================================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n  Introduction:\r\n\r\n  this project takes Amazon Product ASIN ( something like Product reference for Amazon),\r\n\r\n  and get all details about the product Reviews and Questions about it from the customers\r\n\r\n  ===\r\n\r\n  in Amazon_Asin_V1.0.py:\r\n\r\n  I could read all the product reviews ( Positive and Critical ) ones, using selenium\r\n\r\n  I created Review Items\r\n\r\n  I created Product Items \r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n  in  Amazon_Asin_V1.2.py\r\n\r\n  I will use direct links extracted rather than extracting them using selenim actions, for Positive and Critical Reviews\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n  in  Amazon_Asin_V1.4.py\r\n\r\n  I fixed the json format output by adding .__dict__ for each object before appending to the Data_ variable that will be used later\r\n  to output the json file.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n  in  Amazon_Asin_V1.5.py\r\n\r\n\r\n  I could from main page extract all links for Reviews pag , and Question page ( actually it is a fixed URL for questions)\r\n\r\n  then use these links to go for each page and fetch the data for each scope\r\n\r\n  rather than doing automation form main page to get the links then click on them, I think this faster !!\r\n\r\n  - I work now on fetching questions !!.............. Done\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n  in in  Amazon_Asin_V1.6.py\r\n\r\n  I will enhance the code and remove un-necessary lines\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\n  in in  Amazon_Asin_V1.7.py\r\n\r\n  created class for Amzon Function to be called from Amazon_Asin_V1.7.py\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\n

A full charge only takes 60 minutes and then it lasts for ages, and it automatically powers down after 3 minutes to save the charge. I have a Huawei tablet, an iPhone, and a Samsung Galaxy S9 so to be able to use the stylus on each of these devices is incredible, and as Ive said before because no pairing in required, you can just move seamlessly from one to another. To charge it, you just install the magnetic cap and insert a micro USB cable, (which is included).",

A full charge only takes 60 minutes and then it lasts for ages, and it automatically powers down after 3 minutes to save the charge. I have a Huawei tablet, an iPhone, and a Samsung Galaxy S9 so to be able to use the stylus on each of these devices is incredible, and as Ive said before because no pairing in required, you can just move seamlessly from one to another. To charge it, you just install the magnetic cap and insert a micro USB cable, (which is included).",

Instead, it's got a magnetic port on the end of a short USB cable which makes charging it a lot more inconvenient. It also means that if I ever lose this stupid one purpose cord, I'll be SoL after the battery dies and need a new stylus. The product works for now, not as well as the other off brand one it's replacing but it's serviceable. If it stops working or if anything weird sticks out, I'll update the review. But for now, if this is what the product is, don't buy it. Literally pick any other one. I wish I did.",
